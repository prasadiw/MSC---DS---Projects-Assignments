#Programming Assignment: Machine Problem 8: HBase

We recommend that you take a look at the Tutorial: Introduction to HBase before beginning this assignment. Note that the tutorial refers to HDP 2.3 distro and is from 2015, and we have discontinued using the HDP environment in our course since then. Having said that, reading the tutorial and becoming familiar with the concepts is still useful.
